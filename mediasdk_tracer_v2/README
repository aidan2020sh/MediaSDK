Overview
========

Media SDK Tracer is a tool which permits to dump logging information from the calls
of the application to the Media SDK library. Trace log obtained from this tool is a
recommended infromation to provide to Media SDK team on submitting questions and
issues.

Media SDK tracer tool version is: v1.10.0. Note that 1.10 stands for the Media SDK API
version this particular version of the Tracer is intended for.


Prerequisites
=============

To use this version of the tracer, it is required to have the following products installed
on the system:
- Intel® Media SDL 2014 R2 for Linux* Servers
Please, refer to the release notes of these products on how to install them


Installation
============

1. Rename real Media SDK library:
cd /opt/intel/mediasdk/8086/<deviceid>/
rm libmfxhw64.so
mv libmfxhw64-p.so.1.10 libmfxhw64-p-REAL.so.1.10

2. Add Media SDK Tracer library to the search path:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$INSTALLDIR/mediasdk-tracer-1.10.0:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

4. Create symbolic link to the tracer with the name of Media SDK library:
cd $INSTALLDIR/mediasdk-tracer-1.10.0/lib
ln -s libmfx-tracer.so libmfxhw64.so

5. Generate config file for the tracer:
$INSTALLDIR/bin/mfx-tracer-config --default
$INSTALLDIR/bin/mfx-tracer-config core.type file
$INSTALLDIR/bin/mfx-tracer-config core.file ~/mfxtracer.log
$INSTALLDIR/bin/mfx-tracer-config core.lib /opt/intel/mediasdk/8086/<deviceid>/libmfxhw64-p-REAL.so.1.10

Following this procedure you will set Tracer to dump log to the file called '~/mfxtracer.log'. You may
adjust your configuration with 'mfx-tracer-config' tool.


Running
=======

After installing the tracer you should see the trace in the configured log file (~/mfxtracer.log)
after each run of some Media SDK based application. Make sure that you delete or rename log file
after each run - otherwise new logs will be added to the end of file.


Known issues & limitations
==========================

- This is prototype release of the tracer for - not all functionality can be available
- Syslog logger is not supported
- Some API functions may not be covered by the tracing
